# Secuencial Search algorithm

## About the project:

It consists of **comparing each element of a structure with the element to be found**.

It is obvious that, since it has to go through all the elements, it is **not very efficient**. Moreover, this algorithm can end in two states: **successful** (the searched element was found) or **unsuccessful** (the searched element was not located).

- In the **worst case**, one will have to go through all the elements until the last one is reached. Therefore, it is of linear order **O(n)**.
- The **best case** corresponds to finding the element sought in the first position. **O(1)**
- On **average**, a successful case will be obtained by traversing half of the structure, i.e. *n/2*, so - again - this algorithm is of linear order **O(n)**.
