# Interpolation Search algorithm

## About the project:

Interpolation search is an alternative when certain particular situations arise and offers, on **average**, a **better execution time than binary search**, 
however, in the **worst case**, they offer a **significantly worse** execution time.

It is therefore important to detect **when it is really advantageous to apply** this method:

- **When accessing the element sought is very costly**: For example, accessing an element stored in memory is very fast, but if the element is on a **disk** access is much more costly in terms of **time** and resources.
- When the elements are ordered according to a uniform distribution.

This method is based on analyzing the problem in order to **make an estimate that allows**, from the beginning, **determine where the element** to be found is located. 

A value corresponding to the valuation of a much more complex **formula** is taken as a reference. While the calculation of this value makes the process more complex and **slows down each iteration**, in many cases, it is **insignificant compared to the cost of having to access** an element.

- In the **worst case**, when the elements of the structure do not respond to a uniform distribution, this method can have a **linear O(n)** execution time.
- But, if you have a structure with a uniform or at least a fairly uniform distribution, you can get an **average** of ***O(n*Log(Log(n)))***
- In the **best case**, the initial estimate is the element sought ***O(1)***.
